# Disaster-Relief-Haiti
ML Models to Identify Blue Tarps from geo-referenced imagery after 2010 Haiti earthquake.
People displaced were setting up blue tarps as temporary shelters, and the location of these blue tarps could be identified by the images in order to help rescue workers determine where to deliver aid to. The source of the data is from the Rochester Institute of Technology.

Models explored include:
  Logistic Regression
  LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis)
  QDA (Quadratic Discriminant Analysis)
  KNN
  Penalized Logistic Regression
  Random Forest
  SVM (Support Vector Machines)
10-fold cross-validation used to evaluate each of the models
